## Day 24

Difficulty: 1/5 (Part 1), 5/5 (Part 2)

Overview: Part 1 is a rather simple boolean logic simulator which requires a couple passes as values arrive at new wires.  Part 2, yeah I had no clue what I was looking at.  I found a beautiful explaination on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hla5ql/2024_day_24_part_2_a_guide_on_the_idea_behind_the/) that demonstrated that the input was actually a [ripple carry adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Ripple-carry_adder).  Within the comments, [there is a rule based approach that allows you to find the incorrect wires with two passes over the input](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hla5ql/comment/m3lh9un/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

## Day 25

Difficulty: 1/5 (Part 1), N/A (Part 2)

Overview: Honestly the worst part of this day is just parsing the input.  After that its a simple double for loop just checking to see if the sum of the lock column and the key column is greater than 6.
